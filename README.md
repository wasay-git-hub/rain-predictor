# üåßÔ∏è Rain Predictor SMS Alert System

An automated practical Python project that predicts rain for the next 12 hours using a weather API and sends an SMS alert via Twilio if rain is expected. Deployed and scheduled using PythonAnywhere to run daily at 9:00 AM.

## üìå Features

- Retrieves 5-day weather forecast data (3-hour intervals)
- Filters and analyzes the next 12 hours of weather
- Detects if rain is forecasted
- Sends an SMS alert using Twilio:
  > *"It might rain today. Make sure to carry an umbrella!"*
- Automatically runs every morning via PythonAnywhere scheduler

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Weather Forecast API**  
   Uses a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch forecast data based on your location (latitude & longitude).

2. **Rain Detection Logic**  
   Checks 4 forecast entries (each 3 hours apart) to cover the next 12 hours. If any entry forecasts rain, it triggers the SMS alert.

3. **Twilio SMS**  
   Sends an SMS to your phone number using Twilio‚Äôs API.

4. **Automation**  
   Hosted on PythonAnywhere and scheduled to run daily at 9:00 AM.
